# Changelog

All notable changes to GCM will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/), and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

## [Unreleased]

### Changed

### Added
- **`gcm ssh upload` / `gcm gpg upload`** — Standalone commands to upload SSH/GPG keys to the profile's configured provider with automatic duplicate detection. Use `--force` to skip the check
- **Auto-upload duplicate detection** — `gcm ssh generate` and `gcm gpg generate` now check if the key already exists on the profile's provider before offering to upload, preventing duplicates
- **Built-in credential helper** — GCM registers itself as git's credential helper for configured provider hosts (`gcm credential-helper`). Git push/pull/clone reads tokens directly from GCM's encrypted store, bypassing the system keychain entirely. External credential store changes (VS Code logout, browser session clear, etc.) no longer break git authentication
- **Git credential isolation** — `gcm use` now isolates git credentials per profile. When GCM is the credential helper, credentials are served dynamically from the encrypted store. In legacy mode (system keychain), it clears previous credentials and stores the new profile's token via `git credential approve/reject`, preventing credential bleed between profiles
- **Credential username pinning** — sets provider-host credential usernames in global git config so git only uses credentials matching the active profile
- **Smart scope fallback** — `gcm use <name>` works anywhere: inside a git repo → session scope, outside → local scope (writes `.gcm-profile`). No more "not in a git repository" errors
- **`--global` clears local overrides** — `gcm use <name> --global` now removes any `.gcm-profile` file and session marker in the current directory
- **`--hide-default` flag on `gcm current`** — outputs nothing when the active profile is the default; ideal for shell prompts that only show an indicator when you've explicitly switched
- **`--clear-credentials` flag on `gcm github logout`** — clears git credentials via `git credential reject` (default: true)
- **Login credential isolation** — `gcm github login*` commands only store git credentials if the profile being logged in is currently active; prevents credential bleed from non-active logins
- **Shell prompt improvements** — uses `precmd`/`PROMPT_COMMAND` hook with a `$_GCM_PROMPT` variable approach (idempotent, no subshell on every keystroke, hides when default is active)
- Profile management (create, list, show, edit, delete, export, import, diff)
- Profile activation with session, global, and local scopes
- Dry-run mode for profile activation
- Session marker file (`.git/gcm-session`) for reliable session detection independent of git config
- Session-aware profile detection: `gcm current` checks session marker → local marker → email matching → global default
- SSH key generation (ed25519, RSA, ECDSA) with auto-upload to the configured provider
- SSH key listing, connection testing, and clipboard copy
- GPG key generation and commit signing management with auto-upload to the configured provider
- GitHub OAuth device flow authentication (`gcm github login-oauth`)
- GitHub Personal Access Token (PAT) authentication (`gcm github login`)
- GitHub CLI token import (`gcm github login-gh`)
- GitHub authentication status overview (`gcm github status`)
- Encrypted token storage (AES-256-GCM)
- Shell integration for bash, zsh, fish, and powershell
- Auto-profile switching on directory change via `.gcm-profile`
- Shell prompt indicator for active profile
- Configuration template management (create, list, show, delete, import/export, apply)
- Backup and restore with tar.gz archives
- Backup pruning with retention policy
- Profile validation (basic and deep filesystem checks)
- System health check (`gcm doctor`)
- Cache cleaning utility
- Audit logging (JSONL format)
- Responsive table output (auto-adapts to terminal width: truncate → hide columns → vertical cards)
- Cross-platform support (macOS, Linux, Windows)
- Comprehensive CLI with colors, spinners, and interactive prompts
- GoReleaser configuration for automated releases
- Makefile with build, test, lint, and release targets
- Unit tests for core packages (crypto, file service, logger, profile, version)

### Fixed
- **`gcm use` not switching profiles** — session scope (`.git/gcm-session`) now takes priority over local (`.gcm-profile`), so `gcm use <name>` always reflects immediately in `gcm current`
- **Logout credential bleed** — `gcm github logout personal` while on `work` profile no longer clears work's git credentials
- **Profile delete without safeguard** — deleting the active profile now warns and requires extra confirmation
- **Raw error messages everywhere** — all commands that take a profile name now show a clear `✗ profile "x" not found` with actionable suggestions instead of internal filesystem errors
- **`gcm ssh test/copy`** — shows `✗ no SSH key configured` with suggestion to generate one, instead of raw error
- **`gcm backup restore`** — validates file exists before prompting for confirmation
- **`gcm profile import`** — shows clear message when file not found
- **`gcm validate`** — shows clean "not found" instead of raw YAML path error
- **Missing argument messages** — all commands now show usage and help command instead of `"accepts N arg(s), received 0"`

### Changed
- **Profile detection priority** — `gcm current` now checks: session → local → global (was: local → session → global). Session represents the user's most recent explicit `gcm use` action
- **Log verbosity** — all internal operation logs moved from INFO to DEBUG; only shown with `-v` flag. No more `[INFO]` noise in normal usage
- **GitHub OAuth error messages** — connection failures, rejected requests, and missing device codes now show user-friendly messages instead of raw HTTP/JSON errors
