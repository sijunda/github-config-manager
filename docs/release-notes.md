---

## Latest Release

### v1.0.0 — Initial Release (Unreleased)

The first public release of GCM.

#### Highlights

- **Complete Git identity management** — switch name, email, editor, SSH key, GPG key, and provider token with one command
- **Git credential isolation** — `gcm use` pins provider-host credential usernames and manages `git credential approve/reject` so credentials never bleed between profiles
- **Smart scope fallback** — `gcm use` works anywhere: session scope in git repos, local scope (`.gcm-profile`) elsewhere. No more "not in a git repository" errors
- **Three activation scopes** — session (shell only), global (default, clears local overrides), and local (pinned to directory)
- **SSH key generation** — Ed25519, RSA (2048-4096), ECDSA (P-256) with native Go crypto; auto-upload to the configured provider if authenticated
- **GPG signing** — generate keys, enable/disable per profile; auto-upload to the configured provider if authenticated
- **GitHub OAuth device flow** — secure browser-based authentication
- **Login credential isolation** — logging into a non-active profile stores the token but does not affect git operations until you switch
- **Encrypted token storage** — AES-256-GCM with Argon2id (legacy PBKDF2 read-compatible), OS keychain support
- **Built-in credential helper** — bypasses system keychain (osxkeychain/wincred), serves tokens directly from GCM's encrypted store; immune to VS Code logout or external credential changes
- **Shell integration** — auto-switch on `cd` for bash, zsh, fish, powershell; `precmd` prompt indicator with `--hide-default` support
- **Templates** — reusable profile blueprints for team standardization
- **Backup & restore** — tar.gz archives with retention-based pruning
- **Audit logging** — JSONL format, daily rotation
- **Diagnostics** — `gcm doctor` checks all dependencies and configuration
- **Cross-platform** — macOS, Linux, Windows (amd64, arm64)
