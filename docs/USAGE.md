## 1. What is GCM?

GCM is a command-line tool that manages multiple complete Git identities — not just `user.name` and `user.email`, but also SSH keys, GPG signing keys, provider tokens, and editor preferences — and switches between them with one command.

**Key features**

- Named **profiles** (`work`, `personal`, `client-x`, …)
- Per-directory auto-switching via a `.gcm-profile` file
- Native SSH key generation (Ed25519 / RSA / ECDSA) with encrypted-at-rest passphrases
- GPG key generation and per-profile signing toggles
- GitHub/GitLab provider login with AES-256-GCM token storage
- YAML templates for reproducible profile creation
- Timestamped backup / restore with zip-slip protection
- JSONL audit log of every state change
- Shell integration for bash / zsh / fish / PowerShell

## 2. Requirements

| Tool    | Required | Notes                                 |
| ------- | -------- | ------------------------------------- |
| Git     | Yes      | 2.20+ recommended                     |
| OpenSSH | Yes      | `ssh`, `ssh-add` on `PATH`            |
| GPG     | Optional | Only needed for commit signing        |
| Go      | Optional | Only needed to build from source      |
| Shell   | Yes      | bash, zsh, fish, or PowerShell        |

Run `gcm doctor` any time to verify the environment.

---

## 3. Installation

### Option A — build from source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sijunda/git-config-manager.git
cd git-config-manager
make build            # produces ./bin/gcm
make install          # copies to $(go env GOPATH)/bin/gcm (no sudo)
# or: make install-system   # copies to /usr/local/bin/gcm (needs sudo)
gcm version
```

Make sure `$(go env GOPATH)/bin` is on your `PATH` (typically `~/go/bin`).

### Option B — prebuilt binary

Download the archive and `checksums.txt` for your platform from the same release page, verify the archive checksum, extract it, and move the `gcm` binary onto your `PATH`:

```bash
shasum -a 256 -c checksums.txt --ignore-missing
tar -xzf gcm_<version>_<os>_<arch>.tar.gz
sudo mv gcm /usr/local/bin/
chmod +x /usr/local/bin/gcm
gcm version
```

### Option C — `go install`

```bash
go install github.com/sijunda/git-config-manager/cmd/gcm@latest
```

Make sure `$(go env GOPATH)/bin` is on your `PATH`.

---

## 4. First-Time Setup

### 4.1 Install shell integration

```bash
gcm init
```

This detects your shell and appends a marked block to your rc file, and registers GCM's built-in credential helper for configured provider hosts (bypassing the system keychain so git auth is immune to VS Code logout or external credential changes):

```
# >>> GCM shell integration >>>
…
# <<< GCM shell integration <<<
```

If auto-detection picks the wrong shell, set the `SHELL` environment variable before running:

```bash
SHELL=/bin/zsh gcm init
```

Then **restart your shell** (or `source ~/.zshrc`, etc.). After restart you get:

- Auto-switching when you `cd` into a directory with `.gcm-profile`
- An active-profile indicator in your prompt

### 4.2 Verify the environment

```bash
gcm doctor
```

Checks Git, SSH, GPG, data directory permissions, and the shell integration block.

---

## 5. Creating Your First Profile

### 5.1 Interactive wizard (recommended)

```bash
gcm profile create work -i
```

The four-step wizard prompts for:

1. **Basic info** — display name, Git `user.name`, Git `user.email`, default editor
2. **SSH key** — generate a new key (Ed25519 by default) or link an existing one; optional passphrase (stored AES-256-GCM encrypted)
3. **GPG signing** — generate a new key or link an existing key id; toggle auto-signing
4. **GitHub** — username and optional device-flow login

### 5.2 Non-interactive (scriptable)

```bash
gcm profile create work \
  --name  "Jane Doe" \
  --email "jane@company.example" \
  --ssh-key ~/.ssh/id_ed25519_work \
  --editor code
```

Flags:

| Flag              | Description                               |
| ----------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| `-i, --interactive` | Launch the full wizard                  |
| `--name`          | Git `user.name`                           |
| `--email`         | Git `user.email`                          |
| `--ssh-key`       | Path to an existing private key           |
| `--editor`        | Default Git editor (`vim`, `code`, `nano`…) |

Profiles are stored as YAML in `~/.gcm/profiles/<name>.yaml`.

### 5.3 Profile naming — what should I call them?

The word after `gcm profile create` is just an **identifier you pick**. There is no special `work` profile — you could call it `acme-corp`, `personal`, `client-foo`, `gh-main`, whatever makes sense.

**Rules (enforced by the validator):**

- No path separators (`/`, `\`) or `..`
- No control characters (newline, tab, etc.)
- Not empty

**Recommended:**

- Lowercase letters, digits, `-`, `_`
- Short — the name shows up in your prompt on every `cd`, so `(work)` reads better than `(company-i-joined-in-2026)`
- Case-sensitive — `Work` and `work` are two different profiles, pick one style and stick to it
- Avoid spaces — legal but awkward to quote in the shell

All of these are valid:

```bash
gcm profile create work
gcm profile create personal
gcm profile create acme-corp
gcm profile create client_foo
gcm profile create gh-personal
gcm profile create oss-contrib
gcm profile create bootcamp-2026
```

### 5.4 Common multi-profile scenarios

**Day job + personal**

```bash
gcm profile create work     -i   # jane@company.example
gcm profile create personal -i   # jane@gmail.com
```

**Freelancer with multiple clients**

```bash
gcm profile create personal      -i
gcm profile create client-acme   -i
gcm profile create client-globex -i
gcm profile create client-stark  -i
```

**One machine, multiple GitHub orgs**

```bash
gcm profile create gh-personal -i
gcm profile create gh-tokopedia -i
gcm profile create gh-gojek    -i
```

**Employee + open-source + anonymous account**

```bash
gcm profile create dayjob -i
gcm profile create oss    -i
gcm profile create anon   -i
```

In every case, one profile = one full Git identity (name, email, SSH key, GPG key, provider, and provider token). Use separate profiles for GitHub and GitLab accounts. After creating them, pin each repo tree with `gcm use <name> --local` once and they will auto-activate on `cd`.

### 5.5 Renaming a profile

There is no built-in `rename`, but export → edit → import does the job:

```bash
# 1. export the profile's YAML
gcm profile export old-name > /tmp/profile.yaml

# 2. edit the "name:" field inside the file to the new identifier
${EDITOR:-vim} /tmp/profile.yaml

# 3. import under the new name, then delete the old entry
gcm profile import /tmp/profile.yaml
gcm profile delete old-name -y

# 4. if this profile was pinned in any directory, refresh the .gcm-profile
cd ~/code/that-repo
gcm use new-name --local
```

---

## 6. Activating a Profile

```bash
gcm use work              # smart: session (git repo) or local (elsewhere)
gcm use work --global     # persist as the machine-wide default
gcm use work --local      # pin to the current directory (.gcm-profile)
gcm use work --dry-run    # preview changes, apply nothing
```

What `gcm use` does:

- Writes Git config (`user.name`, `user.email`, `core.editor`, `commit.gpgsign`, `user.signingkey`)
- Loads the SSH key into the ssh-agent via `ssh-add` (if configured and key file exists)
- **Pins provider credential usernames** so git only uses this profile's account
- If GCM is the credential helper: git will ask GCM dynamically for credentials
- If GCM is NOT the credential helper (legacy): **clears old credentials** and **stores new credentials** for the profile
- Verifies provider token validity (best-effort, warns if expired)

> **Credential isolation:** After switching, `git push`/`git clone` will authenticate as the active profile's selected provider account only. Other stored credentials cannot bleed through.

> **Smart scope:** Without `--global` or `--local`, GCM uses session scope (`.git/gcm-session`) inside a git repo, or local scope (`.gcm-profile`) outside one. This means `gcm use` **always works** — no "not in a git repository" errors.

### Show the active profile

```bash
gcm current                         # full details
gcm current --short                 # just the name, for scripts or prompts
gcm current --short --hide-default  # nothing if default is active (shell prompts)
```

### Refresh after external edits

```bash
gcm refresh            # re-apply current profile
gcm refresh --silent   # no output, useful in shell hooks
```

---

## 7. Daily Workflow

A realistic setup with two identities:

```bash
# one-time
gcm profile create work     -i
gcm profile create personal -i

# pin each repo tree once
cd ~/code/company
gcm use work --local

cd ~/code/personal
gcm use personal --local
```

From then on, just `cd` between the trees. GCM detects `.gcm-profile` in the current or parent directory, activates the right profile, and updates your prompt. No manual switching.

For a one-off override inside a pinned directory:

```bash
gcm use personal        # session only, doesn't touch .gcm-profile
```

---

## 8. Managing Profiles

```bash
gcm profile list                                  # alias: ls
gcm profile show work                             # detailed view
gcm profile edit work -n "Jane Smith"             # update display name
gcm profile edit work -e "jane@new.example"       # update email
gcm profile edit work -n "Jane" -e "j@x.com"     # update both at once
gcm profile delete work                           # alias: rm; prompts for confirmation
gcm profile delete work -y                        # skip confirmation
gcm profile export work                           # prints the YAML to stdout
gcm profile import ./work.yaml                    # imports from a file
gcm profile diff work personal                    # side-by-side comparison
```

> **Note:** `profile edit` currently supports updating name (`-n`) and email (`-e`) inline. To change other fields (SSH key, GPG, etc.), export the profile, edit the YAML manually, then reimport:
> ```bash
> gcm profile export work > /tmp/work.yaml
> ${EDITOR:-vim} /tmp/work.yaml
> gcm profile delete work -y && gcm profile import /tmp/work.yaml
> ```

Profile names must be filesystem-safe: no `..`, no path separators, no control characters.

---

## 9. SSH Key Management

```bash
gcm ssh generate work                      # Ed25519, no passphrase
gcm ssh generate work -t rsa -b 4096       # RSA 4096
gcm ssh generate work -t ecdsa             # ECDSA P-256
gcm ssh generate work -c "work@laptop"     # custom comment
gcm ssh generate work -p "correct-horse"   # passphrase (encrypted at rest)

gcm ssh list             # keys across all profiles
gcm ssh test work        # ssh -T git@github.com using the profile's key
gcm ssh copy work        # copy public key to clipboard
gcm ssh upload work      # upload key to the profile's provider (duplicate-safe)
```

Keys are generated with Go's native crypto (no subprocess, no passphrase leaking into argv). Private keys are written `0600`, public keys `0644`. If a passphrase is provided, the private key is encrypted at rest using OpenSSH native format (bcrypt-KDF + AES-256-CTR); the passphrase itself is not stored anywhere.

If a provider token is stored for the profile (via `gcm connect <profile> --provider <id>`), GCM will offer to upload the SSH key to that provider automatically after generation.

Flags for `ssh generate`:

| Flag              | Default    | Description                     |
| ----------------- | ---------- | ------------------------------- |
| `-t, --type`      | `ed25519`  | `ed25519` / `rsa` / `ecdsa`     |
| `-b, --bits`      | `4096`     | RSA key size (2048/3072/4096)   |
| `-c, --comment`   | hostname   | Comment baked into the key      |
| `-p, --passphrase`| *(none)*   | Optional passphrase             |

---

## 10. GPG Commit Signing

```bash
gcm gpg generate work         # generate a new GPG key for the profile
gcm gpg list                  # list keys known to GCM
gcm gpg sign enable work      # turn on auto-signing for this profile
gcm gpg sign disable work     # turn it off
gcm gpg test work             # perform a test signature
```

Inputs passed to `gpg` are validated: control characters and `%` are rejected to prevent injection into the batch-mode parameter file.

If a provider token is stored for the profile, `gcm gpg generate` will offer to upload the GPG public key to that provider automatically. Verified badges appear on supported Git hosts.

When signing is enabled, `gcm use <profile>` writes:

```
[commit]
  gpgsign = true
[user]
  signingkey = <key-id>
```

---

## 11. GitHub Integration

For the provider-neutral login path, prefer:

```bash
gcm connect work --provider github
gcm connect work --provider gitlab
```

GCM supports multiple GitHub authentication methods:

```bash
# Method 1: Personal Access Token (headless, CI/CD, fine-grained control)
gcm github login work
echo "$GH_TOKEN" | gcm github login work   # pipe from env/script

# Method 2: OAuth device flow (interactive, browser-based)
gcm github login-oauth work

# Method 3: Import from GitHub CLI (if you already use 'gh')
gcm github login-gh work

# Manage tokens
gcm github status            # show auth status for all profiles
gcm github verify work       # check if token is still valid
gcm github user work         # print GitHub user info
gcm github logout work       # remove stored token
```

**Device flow:** You'll see a short user code and a URL. Open the URL, paste the code, approve. GCM polls until success (respecting RFC 8628 `slow_down` errors) and stores the token encrypted in `~/.gcm/tokens/`.

**PAT:** Generate a token at https://github.com/settings/tokens with scopes: `repo`, `admin:public_key`, `admin:gpg_key`. GCM verifies the token before saving.

**gh CLI:** Requires `gh` to be installed and authenticated (`gh auth login`). GCM imports the existing token.

---

## 12. Templates

Templates are **reusable YAML files** that store Git configuration presets (editor, aliases, pull/push settings, commit options). They are useful for standardizing settings across a team or quickly recreating configuration patterns.

**What templates store** (see `~/.gcm/templates/<name>.yaml`):

```yaml
name: company-standard
description: "Standard config for ACME Corp developers"
git:
  core:
    editor: "code --wait"
    autocrlf: input
  commit:
    gpgsign: true
  pull:
    rebase: "true"
  push:
    autosetupremote: true
  aliases:
    co: checkout
    br: branch
    st: status
metadata:
  author: "Team Lead"
  version: "1.0"
  created: 2026-01-15T00:00:00Z
  updated: 2026-01-15T00:00:00Z
```

**What templates do NOT store:** user identity (name, email), SSH keys, GPG keys, or provider tokens. Those are per-person and belong in profiles.

**Available commands:**

```bash
gcm template create company-standard -i            # interactive creation wizard
gcm template create company-standard --from-profile work  # extract from profile
gcm template list                          # list all templates (alias: tpl ls)
gcm template show company-standard         # print template contents as YAML
gcm template apply company-standard work   # apply template settings to profile
gcm template export company-standard > t.yaml  # same as show, for saving to file
gcm template import ./company-standard.yaml    # import a YAML file as a template
gcm template delete company-standard       # remove a template (alias: rm)
```

**Typical team workflow:**

```bash
# Team lead: create and share a template file
cat > company-standard.yaml << 'EOF'
name: company-standard
description: "ACME Corp standard settings"
git:
  core:
    editor: "code --wait"
  commit:
    gpgsign: true
  pull:
    rebase: "true"
metadata:
  version: "1.0"
  created: 2026-01-15T00:00:00Z
  updated: 2026-01-15T00:00:00Z
EOF

# Share this file via repo, wiki, or Slack

# Team member: import and review
gcm template import company-standard.yaml
gcm template show company-standard
```

Templates are a **reference** — they are not automatically applied to profiles. Use `gcm template apply <template> <profile>` to merge template settings into a profile.

---

## 13. Backup & Restore

```bash
gcm backup create                  # snapshot of ~/.gcm → timestamped .tar.gz
gcm backup list                    # alias: ls
gcm backup restore <file>          # prompts before overwriting
gcm backup prune                   # keep the last 5 (default)
gcm backup prune --keep 10         # keep the last 10
```

Backups are stored in `~/.gcm/backups/` (permissions forced to `0700`). Restore extraction is guarded against path-traversal ("zip-slip") — any entry pointing outside the target directory is rejected.

Before overwriting, `restore` asks for confirmation unless you've already exported the profiles you care about.

---

## 14. Diagnostics & Validation

```bash
gcm validate               # check every profile
gcm validate work          # check one profile
gcm doctor                 # full environment check
```

`validate` looks at YAML schema, referenced SSH/GPG paths, token presence, and permissions. `doctor` adds Git/SSH/GPG version checks and shell-integration status.

---

## 15. Configuration Reference

**Data directory layout:**

```
~/.gcm/
├── config.yaml           # global settings
├── profiles/             # one YAML file per profile
├── templates/            # YAML template blueprints
├── tokens/        (0700) # encrypted provider tokens
├── backups/       (0700) # timestamped .tar.gz snapshots
├── logs/          (0700) # audit-YYYY-MM-DD.jsonl
└── cache/                # transient
```

**Sample `config.yaml`:**

```yaml

## 16. Security Model

- **Filesystem permissions** — `tokens/`, `backups/`, `logs/` are forced to `0700`; private keys `0600`; public keys `0644`.
- **Token encryption** — GitHub OAuth tokens are encrypted with **AES-256-GCM**, key derived via **Argon2id** from the master password (legacy tokens use PBKDF2, transparently migrated on next save).
- **SSH passphrases** — embedded in the private key file using OpenSSH native encryption (bcrypt-KDF + AES-256-CTR); never stored separately or passed on argv.
- **GPG batch input validation** — control characters and `%` are rejected to prevent parameter-file injection.
- **Audit log** — `~/.gcm/logs/audit-YYYY-MM-DD.jsonl`, one JSON object per state change (profile switch, key generation, token write, backup, restore).
- **Backup restore** — zip-slip check rejects any archive entry escaping the target directory.
- **Shell integration** — framed with `# >>> GCM shell integration >>>` / `# <<< GCM shell integration <<<` so uninstall is exact.
- **HTTP client** — 30 s timeout, context-aware OAuth polling with a 15 min overall deadline.

## 19. Troubleshooting

### Shell integration isn't loading

1. Run `gcm init` to reinstall the block (set `SHELL` env var if auto-detection fails).
2. Restart the shell (don't just `source`).
3. Confirm the block exists:
   ```bash
   grep "GCM shell integration" ~/.zshrc
   ```

### Profile doesn't auto-switch on `cd`

- The directory (or one of its parents) needs a `.gcm-profile` file. Create it with `gcm use <name> --local`.
- Make sure shell integration is active: the prompt indicator (`$_GCM_PROMPT`) should change after `cd`. Run `gcm current` to verify the active profile.

### `Permissions 0644 for 'id_ed25519_work' are too open`

```bash
chmod 600 ~/.ssh/id_ed25519_work
```

GCM writes correct perms on generation — this only happens for keys imported from elsewhere.

### GitHub device flow says `authorization_pending` forever

- Make sure you approved on the exact URL GCM printed.
- There's a 15 min deadline; run `gcm github login <name>` again if you missed it.

### `gcm use` seems to do nothing

Run with `-v` (verbose) to see debug logs:

```bash
gcm -v use work
```

This logs every Git config write, SSH config mutation, and agent call. Also check:

```bash
gcm current               # check what's currently active
gcm validate work         # check for config issues
```

### Git still authenticates as the wrong account

After `gcm use`, git should only use the active profile's credentials. If you're still seeing the wrong account:

1. **Check credential username pinning:**
   ```bash
  # Replace github.com with the profile's provider host when needed.
   git config --global credential.https://github.com.username
   ```
  This should show the active profile's provider username.

2. **Clear stale credentials manually:**
   ```bash
   gcm github logout <old-profile> --clear-credentials
   gcm use <correct-profile>
   ```

3. **Verify which account git sees:**
   ```bash
   ssh -T git@github.com   # SSH check
   # or for HTTPS:
   git credential fill <<< "protocol=https
   host=github.com
   "
   ```

4. **macOS Keychain note:** If you previously saved credentials via Keychain Access, they may override GCM's pinning. Open Keychain Access → search "github.com" → delete old entries, then re-run `gcm use`.

### Reset a broken state

```bash
gcm clean        # remove cache directory
gcm clean --all  # also remove logs directory
```

If you need to fully reset GCM, back up first and then remove the data directory manually:

```bash
gcm backup create
rm -rf ~/.gcm    # irreversible — make sure you have a backup
```

---

## 20. Uninstall

1. **Remove shell integration** — open your rc file and delete the block between `# >>> GCM shell integration >>>` and `# <<< GCM shell integration <<<`. Restart the shell.
2. **Export anything you want to keep:**
   ```bash
   gcm backup create
   cp ~/.gcm/backups/gcm-*.tar.gz ~/safe-place/
   ```
3. **Remove the data directory:**
   ```bash
   rm -rf ~/.gcm
   ```
4. **Remove the binary:**
   ```bash
   sudo rm /usr/local/bin/gcm
   ```

Done. Your SSH keys in `~/.ssh/` are untouched; only the GCM-managed data directory is removed.
